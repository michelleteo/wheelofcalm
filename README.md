This is the Wheel of Calm tool.

1. To replicate a text section, copy and paste the code segment in `index.html` starting with `<div class="textSection">` to its corresponding `</div>`.
2. To add more text columns within a text section, copy and paste the code segment in `index.html` starting with `<div class="textColumn">` to its corresponding `</div>`. Make sure you also update the `flex-basis` style in `main.css` to 100% / number-of-columns. For instance, the `flex-basis` value for 2 columns is set to 50%, while if there are 3 columns, its value should be 33%.
